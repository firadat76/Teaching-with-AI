# AI-Powered Grading with Gradescope  
ðŸš€ *Automate grading, provide better feedback, and analyze student performance using AI.*

## Objective  
This activity guides educators in using **Gradescope** to:  
- **Streamline grading** for handwritten, digital, and coding assignments  
- **Leverage AI-assisted grading** for consistency and efficiency  
- **Analyze student performance** with detailed analytics

## Step-by-Step Activity  

### 1. Set Up a Gradescope Assignment  
1. **Log in to [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/)** (instructor account required)  
2. **Create a new assignment**:  
   - Select **"Assignment"** â†’ Choose type (*Exam/Quiz, Homework, Lab, etc.*)  
   - Upload a **PDF template** (for handwritten submissions) or **link to a coding environment**  
3. **Configure settings**:  
   - Set due date, submission type (*variable-length, fixed-template*)  
   - Enable **AI-assisted grading** (if available for your plan)  

---

### 2. Student Submissions  
- Students submit:  
  - **Scanned PDFs** (for handwritten work)  
  - **Direct code uploads** (for programming assignments)  
  - **Online answers** (for bubble sheets/text responses)  
- **Enable AI-based parsing** (if applicable) to auto-match answers to rubric items

### 3. AI-Assisted Grading  
1. **Create a rubric**:  
   - Define point values and criteria (e.g., "Correct solution: 5 pts")  
   - Use **"AI Grouping"** to cluster similar answers (*e.g., wrong answers with the same mistake*)  
2. **Grade submissions**:  
   - Gradescope's AI suggests **rubric matches** based on past grading  
   - Adjust manually as needed  
3. **Apply bulk feedback**:  
   - Add comments to **all similar answers** at once (e.g., "Check sign error in step 2")  

---

### 4. Analytics & Feedback  
1. **View analytics dashboard**:  
   - Identify **common mistakes** (AI highlights frequent errors)  
   - Compare **student performance** across questions  
2. **Export grades** to LMS (Canvas, Blackboard, etc.)  
3. **Release feedback**:  
   - Students see **per-question breakdowns** and AI-grouped comparisons
